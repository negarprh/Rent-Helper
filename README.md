# 🏠 RentHelper - iOS Rental Listing Application

RentHelper is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to browse rental properties, authenticate securely, and persist favorite listings locally.

The project demonstrates a hybrid mobile architecture combining:

* 🔐 Firebase Authentication
* ☁️ Firebase Firestore (Cloud Database)
* 💾 CoreData (Local Persistence)
* 🧭 MVVM Architecture
* 🗺️ MapKit (planned)
* 💳 Stripe (planned)

The application is developed through **three structured iterations**, progressively building from architecture setup to fully working user flows.

# 📌 Project Overview

RentHelper simulates a rental discovery platform where users can:

* Create an account
* Log in securely
* Browse rental listings
* View detailed property information
* Save listings as favorites
* Persist favorites after app restart

The design separates:

* Cloud-based listing data (Firestore)
* Authentication (Firebase Auth)
* Local user persistence (CoreData)

---

# 🏗 Architecture

The project follows the MVVM pattern:

```
Views → ViewModels → Services → Firebase / CoreData
```

### Layers

**Views**

* SwiftUI screens
* NavigationStack + TabView
* State-driven UI updates

**ViewModels**

* Manage loading states
* Handle async operations
* Expose data to UI

**Services**

* `AuthService` → Firebase Authentication
* `ListingService` → Firestore integration layer

**Persistence**

* CoreData stack
* `FavoriteListing` entity
* User-specific local storage

# 🔐 Security Notes

* `GoogleService-Info.plist` is not committed to GitHub
* Stripe secret keys are never stored client-side
* Firestore rules restrict write access
* Favorites stored locally to reduce cloud exposure
